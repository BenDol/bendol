## Hi there, I’m Ben Dol 👋

![Your GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=BenDol&show_icons=true&theme=dark)

I’m a senior software engineer with over a decade of experience building and maintaining open-source tools—mostly in the gaming and modding space. I enjoy blending technical rigor with creative problem-solving, whether that means architecting a custom game server in Java or scripting autonomous bots in Python and Lua. When I’m not coding, you can find me writing about U.S. politics and policy on [my Substack](https://bendol.substack.com)

and of course ![](https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com/?font=Fira%20Code&pause=250&color=79FF97&width=150&height=11&size=11&vCenter=true&lines=GAMING;ALWAYS+GAMING;BUT+LETS+BE+REAL...;ALWAYS+WORKING+:%29).

  I created an [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5) framework I've coined as [DaggerEngine](https://github.com/BenDol/DaggerEngine-UE) as a learning project for UE5.
  - [Dagger Engine](https://github.com/BenDol/DaggerEngine-UE) - Engine code used accross all games
  - [Dagger](https://github.com/BenDol/Dagger-UE) – Core sample game project utilizing Dagger Engine
  - [Dagger Test Game](https://github.com/BenDol/DaggerTestGame-UE) – Skeleton sample template project utilizing Dagger Engine

  I founded and maintain [RisingV-Mods](https://github.com/RisingV-Mods), where I build and document a modular modding framework for V Rising.  
  - [RisingV-Mods/.github](https://github.com/RisingV-Mods/.github) – Organization-level landing README & templates  
  - [RisingV-Mods/RisingV.Docs](https://github.com/RisingV-Mods/RisingV.Docs) – Full documentation site for the RisingV framework
