## Hi there, I’m Ben Dol 👋

![Your GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=BenDol&show_icons=true&theme=dark)

I’m a senior software engineer with over a decade of experience building and maintaining open-source tools—mostly in the gaming and modding space. I enjoy blending technical rigor with creative problem-solving, whether that means architecting a custom game server in Java or scripting autonomous bots in Python and Lua. When I’m not coding, you can find me writing about U.S. politics and policy on [my Substack](https://bendol.substack.com) and of course gaming.
